# U-Seum

## What is U-Seum?

Designed for the beginner to art history, U-Seum is a powerful application to search for art across multiple museum databases. Results are returned as thumbnails, which when clicked will open a popup with an enlarged image, along with details on its title, author, date, and source.

Most results also include two Wikipedia items per image: a snippet introducing a Wikipedia page related to the object's title and a link to the page in question, so that visitors may learn more about subjects related to the given work of art.

Guests are invited to start an account on U-Seum, to store "favorite" works to a database and review them on a single page.

As of October 2016, U-Seum employs APIs provided by the Rijksmuseum of Amsterdam and the Harvard Art Museums. Our next development steps will include expanding our APIs to include results from the Brooklyn Museum and the British Museum.

## Best way to use U-Seum!
The current version (as of October 5, 2016) requires user login to search for images. (Guests may use the dummy email "email@email.com" and password "email123!".) Clicking the magnifying glass icon opens the "Search" input field.

Access your account information clicking on the black logo on the page's upper left corner: a sidebar links to the home page, user biography, favorited images, and recent searches.
